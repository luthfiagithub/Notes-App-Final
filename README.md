# ðŸ“˜ Notes App â€” Final Submission: Fundamental Web Application with React

This project is the **final submission** for the **Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Web dengan React** course on [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/).  
Unlike the first-stage submission, this version implements more advanced features such as **authentication**, **API integration**, **theme switching**, and **multi-language support**, while still maintaining the **Single Page Application (SPA)** concept using **React Router DOM**.

## Project Description
Notes App is a web-based note-taking application where users can:
- Register and log in securely  
- Create, read, delete, and archive notes  
- Change the appâ€™s language (Indonesia / English)  
- Switch between light and dark themes  

All data (notes, users, and sessions) are managed using an **external API**.  
The app only uses **Local Storage** to store the login session token, ensuring a better and more secure experience.  
Despite multiple pages like Login, Register, Home, Archive, and Detail, the application is built entirely as a **Single Page Application (SPA)**.
